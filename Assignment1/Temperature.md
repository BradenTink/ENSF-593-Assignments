	- Temperature Class has two public methods getFerinheit, getCelsius

## Execution and Testing

# Reflection
- Found the assignment helped with understanding methods and objects. I would change the assignment so the user needs to select a base unit before the program is started so that a conversion would need to be held in the getFerinhiet method instead of no conversion as its already in the right base unit.
